# dotTheory - FE: Creating Your Own Build Scripts

## Instructions

1. Create a new repository named `sass-<your-username>` (e.g. `sass-joshuacerbito`)
2. Add Josh and your supervisor as collaborators to the repo
3. Push all of the files in this directory to that new repo
4. Initialize a `package.json` file
5. Create your own npm scripts for compiling [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and create a PR for it
6. Create your own npm scripts for compiling JS using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and create a PR for it

## Additional Notes

- Make sure that there's a production version for your build scripts (wherein the output css and js files are minified)
- Also make sure that there's a way to watch for changes in real-time, both for `.scss` and `.js` files
